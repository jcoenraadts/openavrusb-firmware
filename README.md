openavrusb-firmware
===================

openAvrUsb is an open source USB HID interface software project designed to run on Atmel AVR hardware. It includes all source code for simple and reliable communications over USB to embedded devices. For more information on the HID device class, see the hid-sharp project on Github (check the wiki!).

This project was born out of the Helion Microsystems HU320 USB interface products. It was found, due to customer feedback, that the real power of these products could only be unleashed by allowing user customisation. While they provided a number of useful interfaces, another processor was often required to do grunt-work at the PCB level. With the software released as open-source, user functions can be added with the utmost of ease.
